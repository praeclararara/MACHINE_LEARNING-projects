# MACHINE_LEARNING-projects
In this growing world, technical achievements are playing a vital role.
We must have heard that technology has started to solve some of the old unsolved problems quite easily.
Machine Learning is one of such technologies which is solving many problems across wider verticals.
ML is helping doctors in the medical industry, armies in the defense, farmers in the agriculture domain, scientists in their innovation, and many more.

But the technologies like AI and ML are new in industries; hence becoming a machine learning engineer or artificial intelligence engineer is not so trivial. Taking the first steps in this field is
challenging not because there are fewer resources available over the internet, but most of the resources are unstructured, and initial learners give up here. So it's always necessary for us to first
find the proper guidance which is structured in such a way that it can keep us motivated throughout our journey.
